# CubeSat Data Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a low-cost system for retrieving, decoding, and visualizing data from CubeSats. Our system processes satellite recordings, decodes the signals, and visualizes the data alongside predicted satellite passes.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Retrieving CubeSat recordings (from public databases or SDR hardware)
- Decoding signals into meaningful data (images or telemetry)
- Displaying results clearly for analysis
- Comparing results to CubeSat reference data (done by another teammate)

> Note: NOAA APT signals are no longer publicly available, so we are focusing on CubeSat data.
