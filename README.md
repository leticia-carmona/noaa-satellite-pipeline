# NOAA Satellite Data Processing & Visualization Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project builds a complete software pipeline for working with Earth observation data from NOAA weather satellites. The focus is on:

- **Predicting satellite passes**
- **Decoding publicly available NOAA APT recordings**
- **Analyzing and visualizing the decoded data**
- **Connecting image data to satellite geometry**

This project *does not* require any hardware to begin — all work uses publicly archived satellite recordings and open data sources.

## Motivation

NOAA weather satellites broadcast images of Earth using the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) protocol. These signals are publicly accessible, and with the right tools we can decode, analyze, and visualize Earth imagery — all with software. This project demonstrates how to build that pipeline end-to-end.
